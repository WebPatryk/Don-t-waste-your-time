Link: https://webpatryk.github.io/Don-t-waste-your-time

## Describtion

It's a landing page. It is largely written using HTML, CSS and JS. It contains information on how to deal with wasted time, how to learn how to control it. The page is written in BEM structure and using SCSS. There are also animations largely written in GSAP. You can also ask me a question through the form that is implemented on the site. It uses a package that minimizes the css code through the package npm. It contains such functions as autoprefixer and compress. If you are interested in this topic I invite you to visit this page. \
ENJOY!
